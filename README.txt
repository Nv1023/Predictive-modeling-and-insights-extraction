 ## 📊 Data Science & Machine Learning Project
## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of data science and machine learning techniques for predictive modeling and insights extraction. The workflow covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

The notebook is structured to provide a clear, step-by-step understanding of the end-to-end ML pipeline.

## 🎯 Objectives

Understand the dataset and clean missing/inconsistent values

Perform EDA to visualize patterns and distributions

Engineer features for better model performance

Train and evaluate multiple ML algorithms

Compare models using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

Provide insights and recommendations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Core Libraries:

Data Handling → Pandas, NumPy

Visualization → Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning → Scikit-learn
